Something suspicious is happening. My connection appears to be getting interrupted whenever I am attempting to download the following items without using a VPN

1. Whonix
2. TAILS
3. Virtualbox

I see nothing implying that I got deauthenticated from my own wi-fi. 

However, if I attempted to download using my current install of TAILS as a VM, it seems to go fine. It also works if I manually connect either Kali Linux or TAILS to Nord VPN using the ovpn profiles.
