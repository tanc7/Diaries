I don't know what to say anymore. I deduced the stalker's method of projecting the audio to my head. By applying log analysis of my Wi-Fi hacking tools over the course of roughly a month. Specifically a wardriving app called Wigle.

It's Radio Shack hacking on a new level. The devices have common traits, such as reporting as "null" instead of identifying themselves as a specific device in my logs, and often have strange names and ESSIDs/hostnames. Often they operate on radio channels far beyond the capabilities of 5Ghz Wi-Fi.

In my Wigle database, I detected several suspicious MAC addresses, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth devices that resolve into vendors of specialty RF equipment. The main trait is that there were multiple instances appearing in the database. MAC addresses of vendors of components such as transistors, multi-antennae array components, and mp3 decoders from Silicon Labs, Diffon Corporation, Infineon Technologies, and Microchip Technology. They were all detected in my Wigle logs.

Oddly, the aforementioned manufacturers produce only components of RF/Wi-Fi/Bluetooth equipment and not a entire all-in-one solution.

Whoever these people are, if I ever will meet "her"... They mastered the art of RF hacking. Down to the component level. They literally built the technology that amounted to what comprises of "the voices".

The voice to skull technology is real. But they built it and configured the means themselves. That means that they are NOT gang stalkers, but at least were inspired by stories of gang stalkers.

What do these people want, I cannot be sure. The voices promised to remain with me forever whether I like it or not. They promised to turn me into a cyber security professional at significant cost. The relationship between I and the voices is a unstable truce, often reflected by my mistrust of their intents.

I'm terrified at what the future holds.
