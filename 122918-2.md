# Near total data loss just for installing Endpoint Protection

I finally got my system restore completed after so many hours of waiting.

Previously I broke my Windows installation by installing Symantec Endpoint Protection, which mysteriously prevented the operating system from booting. I later learned on Reddit that Symantec had a history of employing unapproved methods in it's installations, such as deploying rootkits and Packers vulnerable to heap sprays (according to Google project zero)

I was considering the nuclear option and thought about reinstalling the PC outright. Thank God it did not have to come to that.

I basically booted the laptop into safe mode and initially attempted to remove Symantec Endpoint Protection only to find it too difficult to budge. I then attempted to fix the master boot record with command prompt using bcdedit and bootrec.

Then I learned that my Hitman Pro installation gave me a one day old snapshot that I can use system recovery on.

It took over eight hours before the system reverted to normal.

Never in my life did I ever consider a simple anti malware installation to be so damaging.

# Which later became total loss of data as I was forced to wipe the defective installation

My mistake.... Now it blue screens on boot. Going to start with system file checker and bootrec fix boot before resorting to hosing the entire installation.

This would be a great time to scrap Windows in favor of Linux if only I can be rid of secure boot. Apparently disabling secure boot does not count as disabling secure boot. Because I got a boot error as soon as I popped in my Kali Linux boot disk.

# Final decision: Decided to Dual Boot Kali Linux + Ubuntu-KVM with LUKS Encryption

That's it. I hosed Windows in favor of Kali Linux installed on the hard disk. I saw enough promise from the OS in Bluetooth functionality to move forward with the plan. Albeit I cannot bring hci0 "up", it was still capable of transmitting and receiving packets. Some of the Bluetooth pentest tools work with this mishapen interface.

This time it will be a dual booting Ubuntu and Kali Linux build with LUKS encryption for maximum access to wireless hacking potential.

It is basically the only reason why you would install Kali Linux directly on the hard disk. Which is to allow Kali to directly manipulate the wireless cards. And from Ubuntu or Debian, I can then install KVM and have Windows boot from there. You still retain 94% of graphics performance after PCI passthrough. So you can play video games in the KVM guest of Windows. While it's running inside of Ubuntu or Debian.

You just got to get the compatible graphics card drivers.

So the end-result is this.

One partition boots up into a full hard disk install of Kali Linux meant for wireless pentesting (and only for wireless pentesting, of Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and RF). Another partition contains either a Ubuntu or Debian host with a KVM hypervisor. 

If I ever needed Windows again, i'll simply virtualize it in KVM. I can ever run video games in KVM with minimal fps loss.
