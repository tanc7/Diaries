# Working on Little_Tommy on HackTheBox.eu

I wrote a python-ptrace based app that allows me to easily inject shellcode into any process pid I want. I wrote two versions, a working version in Python (50% working that is... see below) and a broken C language version.

The goal is to inject shellcode into the process and restart it, the shellcode contains opcodes in Assembly that forces the app to...

1. Select a memory address from a wordlist
2. Double-free the memory address
3. Attempt to dump the stray pointer that now is pointing to unallocated memory to the screen
4. Repeat this on every address in the wordlist

I succeeded in injecting the process but so far I am failing to be able to restart it. The command "ps aux | grep tommy" reveals that the injected process is running in the "T" operating state, meaning that it is being "traced" but has failed to resume normal operations.
