Something suspicious is happening. My connection appears to be getting interrupted whenever I am attempting to download the following items without using a VPN

1. Whonix
2. TAILS
3. Virtualbox

I see nothing implying that I got deauthenticated from my own wi-fi. 

However, if I attempted to download using my current install of TAILS as a VM, it seems to go fine. It also works if I manually connect either Kali Linux or TAILS to Nord VPN using the ovpn profiles.

It could be that the Symantec eOS endpoint sniffers that the FBI has installed on IP's 10.80.0.1 and 10.192.122.1 (a switch-to-a-switch) detected that I was downloading something they do not like (a anonymity tool) and they killed the connection.

I am relying on my outdated TAILS installation more often by the day. TAILS leaves no trace but the lack of storage persistence is annoying. I did however devise a method of file sharing between the host and the guest TAILS using Windows SSH server for Windows 10.

1. Search for "services" in your Windows 10 search tab
2. Activate the following services or manually start them, SSH Server Proxy and SSH Server Broker and SSHDBroker
3. You should be able to SSH from TAILS to Windows 10 by ssh name@10.0.2.2
4. Now configure on Virtualbox VM network settings a port forwarding rule that binds 127.0.1.1:2222 to 10.0.2.15:22
5. Now you should be able to SSH from Windows to Kali Linux by ssh root@127.0.1.1 -p 2222

Using the tunnel that we created, you can seamlessly transfer out and backup the files you saved in your TAILS installation via SSH by using SCP

TAILS --SCP files--> Windows --SCP files--> Kali Linux.

I came up with this because the OnionShare service built into TAILS didn't work.
