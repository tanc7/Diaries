# Uncovered malware

Uncovered a Pupy RAT variant after a chance stumbling on from the netstat -antp command where I noticed my VM was mysteriously connecting to a 10000 on a server remotely.

Checked my IDS logs. It's been active since October 17th. And it has 29 of my IP addresses that are through my VPNs.

Also whoever used it is using Red Hat Enterprise Linux and gcc compiler 4.7

A full report is here below.

# What does this mean?

Well if it was meant to surveil me, then it should be proof that I have so far done nothing wrong. All I did since October 17th is play hackthebox.eu

It also does not mean that my systems are entirely clean despite removing the malware. There could be other processes hiding and waiting to connect to C2. These kinds of payloads behave asynchronously and will continue on with their assigned tasks until it is time to communicate back to C2.

For that reason, I shifted from using a Kali Linux daily driver, to using a combination of Whonix + TAILS instead. Whonix is basically Debian with extra scripts for anonymity. 

Much like someone would use Ubuntu as their daily driver OS, I choose to use Whonix because it provides network session security without giving up persistence. However, if I suspect something is happening, I would immediately switch over to TAILS because it is amnesiac, in that it forgets it's save state and is not persistent, which means any successful malware attacks will simply slide off like teflon.

# However.... the host

The host is susceptible to be a target. And if the host is compromised, then none of my VM's security measures would be worth anything. 

I recently made a public statement that I will be using Cisco AMP for Endpoints as my choice anti-malware solution, that may have made my pursuers reconsider using one of their zero-days as it costed them millions to acquire and they sure as hell wouldn't want to simply blow it on one suspect.

I have yet to install it, but I will soon once I get the trial offer.
