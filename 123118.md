# My New Years project, lasted two days

I scrapped Windows 10 on my MSI GV62 laptop in exchange for Ubuntu-KVM that is (so far) running by virtualization...

1. Mac OSX High Sierra
2. Windows 10 Professional
3. Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.6
4. Kali Linux
5. Whonix
6. TAILS
7. Debian

While it dual-boots alongside a hard drive install of Kali Linux

# Had a ton of frustration

1. I got past the video display incompatibilities by adding nomodeset to GRUB boot options
2. Fixed the screen resolution problem with NVidia patch 415 by setting GRUB_GFXMODE=1920x1080x32 and GRUB_GFXPAYLOAD_LINUX=keep
3. Manually updated my outdated Ubuntu 16.04 install to 18.04
4. Manually updated both the HDD and virtualized versions of Kali Linux

If I had a choice between now and then, I wouldn't have bought a MSI product for the sole purpose of installing a hypervisor on it. Seriously, don't do it. MSI's components are different enough from it's competitors that compatible drivers may be hard to find or nonexistent. I just happened to have gotten lucky that I located a solution that is workable.

And now I am awaiting my Carbon Black Defense trial to be approved. Which will be installed on the Ubuntu host and each VM, including Mac OSX.

# Other things

I am awaiting my bluetooth card to arrive in the mail so I can do bluetooth pentesting.

With the virtualized RHEL 7.6, I plan to use the Criminal Justice standards settings with Carbon Black to create a template fortified-server to practice pentesting against a simulated government database.

The voices for the most part, are observing me while I was working on the network interface for Mac OSX. It took me about half a day before I brought Mac OSX online and capable of interacting with KVM's virbr0.
